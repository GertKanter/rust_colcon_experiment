# rust_colcon_experiment
An experiment in integrating Rust in a C++ node via the CXX crate


This is just an example project about how to embed Rust inside of a C++ node using the CXX crate.
The use case is for people that want to use Rust in their ROS 2 projects, before the official `ros2_rust` client library is stable.
When the client library is fully developed, this code will probably no longer need to be used.
